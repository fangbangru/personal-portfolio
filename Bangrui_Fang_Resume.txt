Experience

• 04/2025 - 08/2025

Firmware & Software Engineer Intern

Phase Advanced

Worked on an iOS app that communicates with hardware phase sensors over the Apple Lightning

Sensor Systems Corp.

interface using SwiftUI and the ExternalAccessory framework.

Edmonton, Alberta

Helped design a command/response protocol and state machine so the app can safely send
commands, read sensor status and logs, and recover from connection issues.
Implemented a binary decoding and calibration pipeline using C++/Swift interoperability to convert
raw frequency data into calibrated pressure and temperature values with polynomial models.
Moved the heavy decoding work onto background queues so large sensor logs can be processed
without freezing the UI.
Built dashboard-style screens with charts, tables, and configuration pages, and added JSON/CSV
export so engineers can easily explore and share measurement data.

• 12/2024 - 12/2024

Robot Competition

Sumbot McMaster

Worked closely with a team of 4 members to plan and execute a robotics design and development

University

project.

Hamilton, Ontario

Developed robot functionality using Arduino and C++ programming, including sensor integration
and control algorithms.
Facilitated team meetings, fostering communication and collaborative problem-solving.

Partnered with one teammate to write and debug the robot's code using Arduino and C++
programming, focusing on sensor integration, motor control, and overall system functionality.
Supported by two teammates who designed robot components, prepared materials, and fabricated
parts using 3D printing technology.
